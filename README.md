Frontend part made by Nehat Vataksi and Sentiliano Zefi.
It includes classes and hooks.We made a filter with radio buttons.
We also created a booking page with input forms for the client.
All of the data go to a database that we created with json-server
To run the json-server you should write in the CMD npm install -g json-server
Then you have to write json-server --watch <filename.json> to run the database on server.
